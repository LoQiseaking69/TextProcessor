# Interactive Text Processing Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook is an interactive tool for natural language processing. It enables users to input text, segment it into sentences, tokenize these sentences into words, count word frequencies, timestamp the processing, and save the results for further analysis.

## Features
- **Sentence Segmentation**: Decomposes text into its constituent sentences.
- **Word Tokenization**: Segments sentences into individual words while filtering out punctuation.
- **Word Frequency Count**: Tallies the number of occurrences for each word within the input text.
- **Timestamping**: Attaches a timestamp to each processed block of text, marking when it was analyzed.
- **Data Persistence**: Saves the processed data in JSON format to a designated folder for persistent storage.
- **Interactive UI**: Provides a user-friendly interface for easy text input and immediate display of processed data.
